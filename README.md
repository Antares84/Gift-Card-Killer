# Formerly, Gift Card Killer. Now, it's a fork/maintainer for Thireus' Untrusted Hosts Blocker.

What is UHB? Say goodbye to tracking, spies, intrusive ads and untrusted hosts. IPv4 support only. Blocks about 3,000 blacklisted hosts! . This tweak's main goal is to block a maximum of third-party hosts used by your applications that have been identified as collecting personal and confidential data (location, contacts, UDID, etc.) for commercial, tracking or advertising purpose.

# Why did I do this? 

UHB is only available via jailbroken iOS device and I want to make it obtainable for everyone. It can be used in Pi-Hole as well as a regular hosts file for your computer.

Thank you for putting the list in dbl.oisd.nl
