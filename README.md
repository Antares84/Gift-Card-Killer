# Formerly, Gift Card Killer. Now, it's a fork/maintainer for Thireus' Untrusted Hosts Blocker.

What is UHB? Say goodbye to tracking, spies, intrusive ads and untrusted hosts. IPv4 support only. Blocks about 3,000 blacklisted hosts! . This tweak's main goal is to block a maximum of third-party hosts used by your applications that have been identified as collecting personal and confidential data (location, contacts, UDID, etc.) for commercial, tracking or advertising purpose.
